# P.1.1.2 The Model Of The Atom: 2
## Order Of Magnitude
An atom is 10 to the power of -10 **This is an order of magnitude as it is involves powers of 10**

	Think of a molecule as 100 atoms in a long line
	The length of the molecule is 100atoms * 10 to the power of -10/atom = 10 to the power of -8
