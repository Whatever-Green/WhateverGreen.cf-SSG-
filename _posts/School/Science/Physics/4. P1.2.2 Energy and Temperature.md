## What is the Difference Between Energy and Temp?
when you transfer energy from the chemical store or a fuel to the thermal store of lets say water... The water particles vibrate more quickly. the individual particles don't get hotter. The energy in the [[Thermal Store]] is measure in joules $j$ . It is based of the arrangement of particles and how fast they vibrate. Temperature is a measure of how much average kenetic energy it has.
