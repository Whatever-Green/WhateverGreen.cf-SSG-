# P.1.2.1 Changes Of State...Density
## What is is density?
**Tells how much mass there is in a certain volume**
If 2 blocks made of the same material they will both have the *same* density it is based on the property of the material. The mass depends on the volume.

## Calculating Density

 $density(kg/m^3)= \frac {Mass (kg)}{Volume  (m^3)}$

## Why are some substances denser as a solid than as a liquid or a gas?
You can use the Particle to Explain this...
in $1cm^3$  of a solid there are more particles that in $1cm^3$ of the same substance but in a the gas state.

## what is conservation of mass??
Particles don't appear or disappear even when the states change. **The Law Of Conservation
