# P1.2.3 [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
## What is it?
It tells how much energy if needed to raise the temp of the object i. e concrete will heat quicker and take less energy to raise the temp unlike a swimming pool that takes longer and more energy to heat up.

## Calculating specific heat capacity
$change in thermal energy= mass(kg) * specific heat capacity(j/kg°c) * change in temperature(°c)$ 
## Why is it useful??
SHC can tell you how resistant a meterial is to change in temp:
water is very reseliant to change in temp meaning its good for central heating systems and also means that oceans are less likely to freeze.  Source pans are made of [[low specific heat capacities]] as they need to heat up quicker. [[Revision]]
